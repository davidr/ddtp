# David's Dumb Thinkpad Power (ddtp) Program

Some random code to play around with various pieces of power management (CPU undervolting,
thermal management, etc.)

### *Warning*:

You absolutely, positively, definitely should not run this on any computer anywhere in its
current state. This reads and sets CPU MSRs with reckless abandon and could reduce any computer
to a smoldering heap of metal, plastic, and failed dreams.
